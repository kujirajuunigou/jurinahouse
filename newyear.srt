00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,440
Hi! Welcome back to Jurina House!

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,700
And also, happy new year!

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,200
Please continue to support me this year

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,340
I'm Jurina Matsui

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,360
Thank you for everything in 2020

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,320
So it's now the year 2021

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,880
2021 is the year of the cow

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,080
Actually I was born in the year of the cow!

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,040
I haven't really mentioned this much

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,460
So some of you might be thinking "Oh, so Jurina was born in the year of the cow!"

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,900
This is my zodiac year

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,660
About how I want 2021 to be

13
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,440
I think that's something I need to talk about

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
I want to make this the year of Jurina Matsui

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,020
That's one thing

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,940
But as for what it actually means to make it my year

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,720
Honestly, I don't know yet

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,340
[You don't know?!]

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,040
Didn't the past year pass by in the blink of an eye?

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,320
It feels like only recently that I said "it's now 2020!"

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,140
When I look back at 2020

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,380
It was a difficult year, I think

23
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,440
I think that was the same for everyone

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
As for me

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,620
In 2020

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,580
I was supposed to graduate from SKE48

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,920
Also my graduation concert was to be in September

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,080
With October being when I would have my final theater performance and graduate

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,040
Unfortunately due to our current situation, we've had to postpone all of this

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,260
Currently, I still don't know when I'd be able to graduate

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,100
Really, how should I put this

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
It's sad

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,340
I've been part of SKE48 for 12 years

34
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,120
Since I was a 6th grader

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,400
And when I realized it, I turned 23

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,520
And because I've done it for so long

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
I was seriously worried about graduation

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,880
It was a decision I made with a lot of determination

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,120
And then announced it

40
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,080
That's why with these developments

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,960
I found it really unfortunate

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,160
But because of it, fans have been telling me

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,600
"We're glad we get to see the idol Jurina Matsui a little longer"

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,120
There were many people who told me that

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,340
Also in these circumstances, we can't do handshake events like before

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,800
So I've been trying a few things, like this YouTube channel

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,040
To be able to reach fans around the world

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,980
I'm happy about that

49
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm taking this very positively

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,200
One reason I started this YouTube channel was also

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,780
In the midst of these difficult times in the world

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,660
I wanted to contribute things that are bright and fun, even if it's just a little

53
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,100
That's why I started doing this

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,120
So far I've uploaded a few videos

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,060
When I do these things in a group

56
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,820
There usually isn't much footage of just me alone

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,520
For example, I've been in some TV shows but

58
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,660
But it's not very often that I get to do things like a special feature where I get a lot of focus

59
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,280
Compared to that, over here I get to show many new sides of me

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,980
This is a great place to do that

61
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,520
That's what I think

62
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,860
This channel, which is called Jurina House

63
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,960
It's a channel that I want to create together with all of you viewers

64
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,700
That's one of the themes

65
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,080
For example, I decided on the channel name out of everyone's suggestions

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,700
And we also have the MC Puppet Mascot

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,640
It will be chosen from the drawings you all send in

68
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,080
We have plans like that

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,660
Make sure you don't miss it!

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,460
It would be really great if we could all do this together

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,760
If there's anything you want me to do on this channel

72
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,060
I'd love it for you to comment freely about it

73
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,840
Fortunately, I'm now on various social networking platforms

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,700
And recently there are a small number of events where I get to meet fans again directly

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,520
I hope you could start telling me your thoughts in such places

76
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,060
I want to keep doing things like that

77
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,280
So I'd be glad if you could tell me your thoughts

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,600
How was 2020 for all of you?
[I'm waiting for your comments!]

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,140
I'm actually quite curious

80
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,440
Right now we can't meet others, and I can't meet my fans

81
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,740
Don't they say "absence makes the heart grow fonder"?

82
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,440
But that's actually true!

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,100
It's because we can't see each other

84
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,100
That I realized even more how important you all are to me

85
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,620
I really felt it during this time

86
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,480
So I really want to express my gratitude to everyone who's kept supporting me

87
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
Thank you so much

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,240
Anyway since I started this YouTube channel last year

89
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm now able to do the things I like doing

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,620
And show my natural side at the same time

91
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,400
Some people think I'm scary and harsh

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,060
Well, they're not actually wrong

93
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,420
When it comes to performances

94
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,900
I want to do it right

95
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,160
Because I want us to encourage and cheer up our fans

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,920
And I want us to show people that the 48 group still has momentum

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,860
That's why there are times when I'm strict towards my juniors

98
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,140
But actually, once our work is done, when we switch off our work mode

99
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm really just like a baby

100
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,020
I think my fans who come to handshake events probably already know this

101
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,660
But I probably don't have that public image

102
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,680
Well, I'm hoping I get to show those sides of me through YouTube

103
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,160
And have people think, "oh Jurina Matsui is actually this kind of person"

104
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,960
I hope I manage to gradually do that in 2021

105
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,040
And make this the year of Jurina Matsui

106
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,500
I'd be glad if all of you can help me out

107
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,480
Please continue to support me in 2021

108
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,200
Also, please subscribe to my channel

109
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,540
And smash the like button on this video

110
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,900
Once again, please support me in 2021!

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,880
I hope this will be a good year for all of you!

112
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,160
Bye bye!

113
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,860
Happy new year!

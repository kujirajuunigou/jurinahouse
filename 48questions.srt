00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Hi! Welcome back to Jurina House!

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,120
1, 2, 3, 4

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,760
All together now

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,720
6, 7, 8, 9

5
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,340
Jurina~!

6
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,560
I'm Jurina Matsui, 23 years old

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,120
So

8
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,960
Today

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,760
For the first time!!

10
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,760
I'll be answering questions!

11
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,340
What questions will I get?

12
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,380
I'm excited

13
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,020
Without further ado

14
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,920
Let's start!

15
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,440
[What's your name?]

16
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,860
Jurina Matsui! I said it earlier!
[Didn't you hear my greeting?]

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,100
[What's the origin of your name?]

18
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,340
I asked my mother, she said "Ju" comes from the word "pearl"

19
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,360
It seems she wanted me to shine brightly like a pearl

20
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,840
[What's your height?]

21
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,540
My height is 163cm

22
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,280
[How old are you?]

23
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,280
23! I said that earlier too!
[Were you even listening?]

24
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,060
[When's your birthday?]

25
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,940

26
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,800
[Your blood type?]

27
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,720
Type B

28
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,760
[Any special skills?]

29
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,980
Dance!

30
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,160
[What's special about your outfit today?]

31
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,260
This looks like a normal white T-shirt, but actually it's not!

32
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,500
Look at this! You can probably see it from behind, but there's a button here

33
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,480
[This week, who did you talk to on the phone for over 5 minutes?]

34
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,240
Grandma!
[I love her!]

35
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,380
[Who do you pay attention to on TikTok?]

36
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,460
hinata-chan!

37
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,100
Which YouTube channels do you like?

38
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,740
Yorochiki Channel! Nadal-san is hilarious

39
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,360
[Yakiniku or Sushi? Go.]

40
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,120
Ohh this one's hard

41
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,580
I love both but

42
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,600
Yakiniku!

43
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,060
[Favorite sports?]

44
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,900
Pro-wrestling, martial arts, basketball, swimming

45
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,200
There's so many... ball games too

46
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,860
I did track and field, so I like it too

47
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,940
[Ever had a paranormal experience?]

48
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,720
A lot!

49
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,300
Once, I went into a haunted house

50
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,180
Where only dolls were supposed to appear

51
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,360
But I felt my legs being grabbed

52
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,720
Another time at a hotel I stayed in

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,020
I woke up in the morning to find my towel full of blood stains

54
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,760
[Sweet? Spicy?]

55
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,920
Sweet, I'm really bad with spicy food

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,740
[Anything you want to do that you can't right now?]

57
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,200
Swimming, I'm so bad at it

58
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,060
[The world ends in 1 week!! How would you spend your final week?]

59
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,580
I'll eat my mom's cooking

60
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,300
[If you were to keep a pet, would you get a dog or a cat? Or something else?]

61
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,760
What do you mean, "something else?"

62
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,580
I already have two dogs, they're toy poodles

63
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,580
If I were to get a new pet

64
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,720
I want to try getting a cat

65
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,360
[What's the hardest word that you know?]

66
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,040
Saishokukenbi (A beautiful and talented woman)

67
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,140
That probably wasn't that hard...

68
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,500
[Who do you want to collaborate with on YouTube?]

69
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,980
The comedienne, Rei Maruyama
[I think it'll be fun!]

70
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,200
She does things like impressions of Tao Tsuchiya

71
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,860
I'd love to do it with her

72
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,780
[What do you get cravings for sometimes?]

73
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,560
Cup ramen! I love it!
[You finish it without realising]

74
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,840
[Right now, draw an animal in under a minute]

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,600
An animal?

76
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Under a minute?

77
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,460
[Drawing start!]

78
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,480
Oh no, hold on, this isn't right

79
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,700
It's done!

80
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,780
- It's done, can I show it?
- Please

81
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,560
It's a cow!
[A cow with way too many spots]

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,720
[If you go on an adventure to the ends of the earth, which SKE member would you bring along?]

83
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,740
Haruka Kumazaki! When I'm feeling down, she'll probably cheer me up!

84
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,420
[Favorite song in SKE48?]

85
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,640
Okidoki!
[Love it!]

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,740
[If you're going to Disneyland, who would you want to go with?]

87
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh that's tough

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh! Yuna Ego, because I promised to go with her!

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,040
[Which SKE48 member would you bring for a drive all around Japan?]

90
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,180
Suzuran Yamauchi! We have good conversations!

91
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,900
She's pretty interesting too

92
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,460
Even if we kept driving, I wouldn't be bored I think

93
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
[Which memory with members makes you go, "that's so nostalgic"?]

94
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,560
When we performed as SKE48 in Nagoya Dome

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,980
In the first song, the 1st generation members stood together on stage

96
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,680
Whenever I meet those members

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,980
I'd think, "we worked hard for that moment on stage"

98
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,380
It's nostalgic

99
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,460
[When was the time you laughed the most in your life?]

100
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,020
I love Downtown, so when I'm in a TV show with the two of them

101
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,160
Matsumoto-san and Hamada-san, they'd do jokes in response to things people say

102
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
I'd always laugh a lot

103
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,120
We just heard a laugh there!
[Incredible timing]

104
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,120
[When was the time you cried the most in your life?]

105
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,440
Back when I starred in the TBS drama "Death Cash"

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,300
In a scene together with Riho Yoshioka

107
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,180
We cried a lot together

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,460
[When was the time you felt the most in pain in your life?]

109
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,220
This happens a lot while changing clothes

110
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,740
When we do quick-changing in concerts

111
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,440
The costume designer would try her best to put my shoes on me

112
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,320
Like for boots, the moment it's zipped up

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,560
My skin would get caught in it

114
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,500
That really hurts a lot

115
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
[Which photo in your phone captures an important memory for you?]

116
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,240
My photo with an important memory is

117
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,800
This one!

118
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,180
SKE48's new single "Koi Ochi Flag" will go on sale on 3 Feb 2021

119
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,460
For me it's also my graduation single

120
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,940
This picture is an offshot from the "Koi Ochi Flag" MV

121
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,820
[Who do you have trouble saying "thank you" to?]

122
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,100
My mother

123
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,520
I really love her a lot

124
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,200
We get along very well too

125
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,360
But it's because we get along that it's hard to say! It's embarrassing

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,440
Around the time I just entered SKE

127
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,520
My mother would be working while taking care of me

128
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,680
She'd always cook delicious food for me

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,660
I really want to say thank you to her for supporting me all this time

130
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, I think she might watch this though

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,480
[Tell us 3 of your favorite movies]

132
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,260
Star Wars, Jumanji, and Ghost

133

[What was your favorite school event?]

134
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,300
I couldn't participate in most school events but

135
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,740
Maybe the sports festival? Because I was often number one at running

136
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,620
[Any embarrassing memories you want to forget?]

137
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,720
Once, while recording for a music show

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,800
I was the only one wearing pants instead of a skirt

139
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,420
It didn't stretch well

140
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,240
After some intense dancing

141
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,500
The button came flying off

142
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,180
[Anything you want to throw away but can't?]

143
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,960
I guess I can't throw away things people give me

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,540
Even for things I bought myself

145
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,540
I'd go, "I went through the trouble of buying it..." and be reluctant to throw them away

146
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,200
So basically I can't throw anything away

147
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,360
[What do you want to tell yourself who's in elementary and middle school]

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
"You know all those celebrities you see on TV?"

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,660
"You'll be appearing alongside them a lot"

150
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,380
[What would you do if you were to do a side gig while being an idol]

151
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,380
I love animals, so I'd work in a pet shop?

152
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,360
And if I wasn't an idol, I might have wanted to be a track and field athlete

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
[Any good food you'd recommend in Nagoya?]

154
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,120
There are sweets from this shop called Salon de Thé Nagoya France

155
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,880
Not many people know of it

156
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,800
But the sweets are really good, it'd be great if you buy them as gifts too

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
[Where in Nagoya would you recommend for someone to have fun?]

158
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,340
For a great time in Nagoya I'd recommend Oasis 21

159
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,840
It's beautiful at night

160
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,180
There are even people from overseas who come to Nagoya just to see it

161
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,400
I definitely recommend it!

162
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,660
[What's the first Aichi prefecture specialty that comes to mind? Answer right away!]

163
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Jurina

164
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,840
What am I even saying

165
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,460
[What kinds of moments make you think "I've come back to my hometown"?]

166
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,340
When I'm in the SKE48 theater in Sunshine Sakae, standing on stage

167
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,640
Or when I'm in local Nagoya TV shows, talking with staff members

168
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,560
They'd say "welcome home!" to me

169
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,720
Those moments, I think

170
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,560
[You're asked to produce an event in Nagoya Castle!! What kind of event will it be?]

171
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,400
When we think of castles

172
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,180
Traditional Japanese clothing comes to mind as something that goes with it

173
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,720
I'd gather some cute girls

174
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,580
And have them wear furisode that I produced

175
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,420
Then have something like a fashion show

176
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,520

193
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,740
I want someone I can do my best with together

I'm totally that type, someone with big dreams

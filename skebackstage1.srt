[English subtitles by @kujirajuunigou]

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,420
- Good work today
- Thank you

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,740
What are your thoughts now that the performance is over?

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,700
Well, first of all

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,420
I feel like "I did it!"

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,640
And also

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,460
It was something I wanted many fans to see

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,200
I mean live, in the flesh

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,340
That's what I strongly felt

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,120
It was a concert good enough for me to feel that way

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,300
[4 October]
[The day of the "Te wo tsunaginagara" stage]

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,520
Good morning!

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,600
It's so cute

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,780
I'm performing at 11:30am

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,560
But they've been doing it since around 9

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
That's way too early

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,400
But because we need to fit 12 stages into 3 days

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
If we don't start early, we can't fit everything in

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,300
Just goes to show how much history we actually have

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,600
It's amazing when you think about it

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,820
You alright?

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Ah, what happened was

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,540
- Miraculously, my hip recovered
- Really?

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,220
But now my feet are hurting instead

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,040
- So it switched places
- Maybe

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,780
Did you ice it?

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,220
Yes, I did

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,940
Good

29
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,200
- I'll do my best today
- I'm counting on you

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,800
This is for Halloween

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
- This is for Halloween?
- Yes

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,480
- I thought it was cute earlier
- It's cute!

33
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,800
It's a little early for this though

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,260
I cried during rehearsal

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,840
"Tooku ni itemo" (Even if you're far away) affected me most I think

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,700
It's a song we'd sing when a member graduates

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,100
On top of that, we're in these circumstances

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Where we can't meet our fans

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,240
All these things came together in my mind

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,340
And my graduation is on the horizon too

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,460
Pretty soon

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,140
I'll be going far away from SKE

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,920
Just too many things like that

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Were overlapping with the song

45
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,340
Like, I wonder if things are going to be alright

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,020
Do you have any particular thoughts about performing on stage?

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,900
Since my debut, for 12 years

48
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,420
What I kept in mind was

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,880
Was that I want people to watch our concerts and performances

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,300
And then for them to think

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,600
"Ah, I'll do my best tomorrow!" or something like that

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,660
I want them to get strength from watching us

53
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,700
When you perform you need to always stay hydrated, don't you?

54
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Yes, yes, that's why

55
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,600
I normally mix a sports drink with water

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
About equal parts of each, and drink it

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,180
Drinking a sports drink as is would be too sweet for me

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,280
So I mix it with water before drinking

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,940
And I don't usually drink cold drinks

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,560
Just normal temperature

61
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,940
I'm eating brown sugar candy

62
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,240
- Do you usually get that brown sugar candy?
- Yes

63
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,060
I was actually surprised 

64
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,580
- It's from Kikaijima, that's pretty far down the south
- Really?

65
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,700
- It's a delicacy from that area
- Wow, Kikaijima?

66
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,900
Okinawa?

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,700
- It's just across Okinawa
- Across Okinawa? Wow

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,660
Thanks for sending this from all the way there

69
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,440
Oh no, I'm really nervous

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,860
My stomach is acting up

71
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,920
Even after performing for 12 years, you still get nervous like this?

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,040
Totally

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
I get nervous every time

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm probably the one who gets nervous the most

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,920
I scream in panic before the performance

76
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,720
For you, what's the number one moment where your switch is flipped to get geared up to perform

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,600
The moment I get geared up 

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,740
I think that would be

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,460
Either the moment I step on stage or

80
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,340
When this music called "Overture" gets played at the start of the concert

81
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,600
The one that goes "SKE48~!"

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,660
The one that starts the concert, it's probably that moment

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,380
At that moment fans would do this cheer, like "sore sore sore"

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,760
At the same time I'd be backstage also going "sore sore sore"

85
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,760
I'd feel like "it's time to go!"

86
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,240
Like "it's about to start!"

87
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,300
It's probably that moment where I get geared up

88
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,860
Alright

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,260
I'll go get changed

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,720
Now that I've put my outfit on, I'm even more nervous

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,860
I'm getting super nervous

92
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,640
- You're nervous?
- I'm nervous

93
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,820
- How nervous are you, out of 100%?

94
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,820
- 99.9%
- Aaahh

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,600
- But if I can still say things like that I'm probably okay
- Yeah, you'll be alright

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Because it's you, Jurina-san

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,240
You're cute

98
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,080
Even when I'm like this?

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,760
- You're like a chihuahua
- You always say that!

100
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,380
Your video went viral

101
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,660
Yeah, that's crazy isn't it?!

102
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,000
The one with Nami-san

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,460
- I was just thinking today that I want to do another one
- Really?

104
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,460
When did you film that one?

105
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,160
Pretty recently, around 4 or 5 days ago

106
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,640
I was so surprised, I didn't expect it to blow up like that

107
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
- Do you know what happened?
- No idea

108
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,880
There were lots of overseas fans

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,340
- Yeah, there were many comments from overseas fans
- That's right

110
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,340
I was so suprised

111
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,820
I'm happy

112
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,320
It went viral when I got here

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,840
Let's try to do another one

114
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,560
Yeah, I'll do my best

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,260
I'm so nervous

116
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,620
One, two...

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,900
One, two

118
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,900
One, two... Good!

119
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,120
Let's do one more

120
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,460
Let's do some taken from the bottom, and change up the angles

121
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,160
Everyone, let's pose freely

122
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,960
One, two...

123
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,960
Okay!

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
It was really only one shot

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,340
When they say "one shot", they'd usually take around 3

126
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,820
Jurina-san!

127
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,740
- Yes?
- It's a little late, but here's a birthday present from me

128
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,160
Really? (lol)

129
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,380
Mine was back in March (lol)

130
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,920
Thanks so much!

131
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
I'm happy

132
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
- Please use it if it's to your liking
- Thanks, I will. I'll look at it later

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,040
- Will you be watching Tetsuna? You'll be staying?
- Yes!

134
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,180
Please watch it

135
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,940
Tell me what you think later

136
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,040
You've been supporting us since way back

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,640
You're a member who also understands the feelings of fans

138
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,580
Thank you!

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,620
The "Te wo tsunaginagara" stage is

140
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,320
The first original stage we received as SKE

141
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,400
It was created specially for us

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,480
Including the lyrics, costumes, and the choreography

143
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,740
There's a strong emotional attachment to the stage

144
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,720
We performed it this time but

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,020
I'm the only one left among the members who first performed it

146
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,760
First, I thought it was important to share my feelings towards the stage

147
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,320
That's why I asked the members performing today

148
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,740
To think of it as though it's their own stage, one they received

149
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,320
And perform with that in mind

150
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,100
I think everyone took that to heart and performed well

151
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,360
And I think that was conveyed to our fans who were watching today

152
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,420
Okay, let's confirm the details for the performance

153
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,840
You were probably already sent this through email but

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,160
It might be better to use the tambourine more

155
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,420
You might move around while singing but

156
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,160
Please make sure you still face towards the cameras

157
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,660
Yes!

158
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,880
Since it's the first song

159
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,800
Let's start off with energetic smiles

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,060
- And for "Mango"...
- For "Mango No. 2"

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,400
It's okay even if you want to fool around more

162
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,100
It's okay even if all of you do that

163
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,460
At the moment it feels a bit low energy, so let's pump it up a bit

164
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,460
When it comes to facial expressions, think of "Pinocchio Gun" but cuter

165
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,080
Even if you make funny faces, it's totally alright

166
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,660
It's the only song where we can fool around

167
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,260
You can show a different side of you there

168
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,980
Then it's "Te wo tsunaginagara"

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,320
Make sure you keep standing there until the cameras go elsewhere, until the very end

170
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,100
Since they told us they won't film us while we're moving around

171
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,660
It's okay even if you're late to your position, please prioritise that

172
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,840
Should we say "Yes"?

173
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,260
"Yes" is probably fine

174
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,300
"Yes! I'm XX! Please be good to me!"

175
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,300
But if everyone says the same thing it might be too much

176
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,980
Maybe we should drop the last bit?

177
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,560
Let's go with "Yes! I'm XX!"

178
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,700
And then just wave, let's go with that

179
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
The rest could just cheer on

180
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,940
Like calling their names

181
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,520
Kind of like what fans usually do for us

182
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,700
To liven things up

183
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,100
Once the 1st row is done, they should separate

184
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,200
We'll do it for the 6th person

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,900
The 2nd row will do the same

186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,420
Then we'll return, say "that was the 16 of us"

187
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,620
And "some members will go get ready"

188
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,540
Also those who have watched us

189
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,720
Told us that our expressions in "Innocence" were all over the place

190
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,760
Let's go with sexy, feminine-type of facial expressions

191
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,340
Like you're trying to seduce the people watching the screen

192
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
And for "Kayou Suiyou"

193
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,260
We should go with a "sexy" but "cold" feel

194
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,760
The lyrics are like that too

195
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,880
They're both sexy but with a contrast

196
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
For example it's okay to give out a smirk

197
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,840
For "Innocence"

198
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,660
Let's all go with the same feel in our expressions, thank you

199
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,840
I mentioned this during the rehearsal too

200
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,260
This is the first original stage we received as SKE

201
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,460
The members from that time are now mostly gone

202
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,300
But I'd like you to think of it as though it's your own stage

203
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,300
while performing today

204
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,500
Today, we can't hold hands, or even use a rope but

205
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,980
There's all that but

206
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Let's all be aware of our fans who are watching on their screens

207
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,340
"While we can't link hands, our hearts are linked"

208
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,200
I hope we can convey that to our fans

209
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Everyone, I'm counting on you

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,420
We can't link our hands, but our hearts are one

211
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,820
Let's make this a great show together

212
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
It's finally starting isn't it?

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,060
It's starting, oh no

214
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,180
It hasn't sunk in yet

215
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:04,680
Today, it is SKE48's 12th Anniversary Fest 2020 ~12 stages back-to-back~

216
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,500
Thank you for coming to the "Te wo tsunaginagara" stage

217
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,540
Before we begin our performances we would like to make a few requests to our guests today

218
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,940
During the performances, standing on your seat, or leaving your seat to run to the front are extremely dangerous

219
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,620
Thus, these behaviours are prohibited

220
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,420
It is prohibited to bring in any form of video and audio recording devices

221
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,000
And finally, please turn off your mobile phones

222
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,980
During the performances today, for the convenience of production

223
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,440
The emergency exit lights in the audience seats will be turned off

224
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,980
In the event of a disaster

225
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,620
Lights will be turned on and you will be guided by the staff

226
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,860
However, please take note of the emergency exits in advance

227
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,480
Also, to minimise the risk of virus transmission

228
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,860
It is prohibited to speak loudly and to stand up

229
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,300
We would appreciate it if you could show your support through hand clapping and penlights

230
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,820
Yes, personally this is my first appearance in "Te wo tsunaginagara" in a long time

231
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,280
I am very nervous

232
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,320
And also to those of you here who were selected as audience

233
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,840
For some of you it may be the first time in a while to see us perform in person

234
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,700
There is some physical distance between us but

235
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,280
Our hearts are linked

236
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,900
Everyone, please enjoy the performances as much as you can

237
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,140
Please enjoy it until the end

238
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,640
This was SKE48 Team S Matsui Jurina

239
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,060
Without further ado, the performances will begin shortly

240
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,200
Thank you

241
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,500
Oh no what should I do, I'm too nervous

242
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,320
The first chorus goes this way, the second chorus goes this way

243
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,760
Okay! Thank you so much

244
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Thank you!

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,520
My mother said she'll be watching

246
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,800
I'd like to take a final sip, a drink please?

247
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,340
Okay, thank you

248
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm seriously nervous, what should I do, I'm in trouble

249
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll do my best

250
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll be going

251
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,400
Everything from that time in the past as well as the present

252
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,480
I'll show it today

253
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,460
"Chime (wa Love Song)" was a dangerous one, I was tearing up

254
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,560
Everyone's about to be surprised

255
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,340
I'm counting on you two

256
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,680
It's like this right?

257
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,540
I finished it!

258
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,540
I did it!

259
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,740
- That was super cool
- Really?

260
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,280
I made a point to make it sexy

261
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,200
How are you now? Has the nervousness gone away?

262
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm still really nervous

263
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,600
But I'm curious what the reaction is going to be, after I performed "Ame no Pianist"

264
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,940
I'll be looking forward to it, as I'm changing

265
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,320
Because Jurina-san was in the middle

266
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,980
This is how she sucks up to me

267
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,500
- Because the cameras are rolling
- She's sucking up

268
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,940
But it's likeable

269
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,020
It's funny

270
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,580
I like that about her

271
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,480
- She's always cheerful
- Please use this footage

272
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,520
Thank you so much

273
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Thank you! It ended smoothly

274
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,180
We finished it

275
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,060
I got emotional there towards the end

276
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,780
I remembered everything that happened until now

277
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,220
Like things about graduated members

278
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,420
It was really linked with the lyrics

279
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,200
It made me remember all that

280
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,180
Also we're in these circumstances where we can't really meet our fans

281
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,380
When I thought of that...

282
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,380
I became sad

283
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,200
And tears started to well up

284
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,680
I told myself not to cry

285
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,340
I wanted to finish everything properly with a smile

286
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
But I failed

287
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,200
Just goes to show that there are so many songs I have an emotional attachment to

288
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:47,980
And I guess with that my feelings came through to everyone

289
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,260
To have been able to do this for 12 years

290
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
It's all thanks to the members, the staff

291
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,460
And the fans

292
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,200
There were many, countless people

293
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,300
Of course my family too

294
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,120
It's because I had all of their support

295
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,500
That I have what I have today

296
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,400
It's a concert that reminded me of that again

297
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,320
- Thank you!
-Thank you!

298
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,160
Thank you~!

299
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,940
- Thank you, good work today
- Thank you

300
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,620
During the performance, you two were the people who smiled at each other the most

301
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,480
That might be true

302
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,440
- We made a lot of eye contact
- I was watching her closely

303
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,300
We worked together for a long time

304
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,140
That's why there were such moments, where we're compatible

305
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,080
And today I got to see Kamata's nice belly too

306
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,240
You're blushing

307
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,260
- Please praise me, Kamata, for not running away
- Good girl, I ran away

308
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,820
- Because I can't wear my old costumes anymore
- Is that so?

309
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,460
You were in elementary school that time right?

310
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah, it's tight around my bottom, and my chest too

311
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,880
- I was surprised to see Jurina-san's "Aozora Kataomoi" costume
- Yeah it's crazy isn't it?

312
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,240
One time we had to wear the original member costumes

313
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,900
We looked at the pants together, and went "are these leggings"?

314
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,860
I feel like I'll fall asleep immediately

315
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,440
Thank you!

316
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,420
We've finished the "Te wo tsunaginagara" stage!

317
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,220
To our fans, thank you so much for these cute flowers!

318
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
It's the best! I love you!

319
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,880
Bye bye!

320
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,740
I'm going home! Good night! Bye!

321
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,280
See you soon!

322
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,280
[To be continued]

1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,020
Good morning!

2
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,260
Let's blow it off properly, my feet

3
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,260
Let's go after this is done

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,700
This is how we did the shoot

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,020
One shot after the other

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,680
I injured my right hand so 

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,020
I tried my best to hide my right hand

8
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
Here's the changing room

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,980
And over here, to help inform us when we're appearing

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,920
Like the setlist, where to go, the order of MCs

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,460
Inoue, Kitagawa, Sakamoto, Nakamura...

12
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,260
JurinaJurina (lol)

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
There will be two Jurinas (lol)

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,620
Sometimes we see things like this

15
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,740
Because they make many of these, it's hard on the staff

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,180
Thanks for always helping us

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,620
I hope our feelings of gratitude will reach you all

18
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,720
Finally

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
I'd like us to unite our hearts and sing together

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Please listen to this song

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,320
"Boku wa shitteiru"

22
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,760
That wraps up the 12th anniversary special concert rehearsal

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,420
After this, it's the "Theatre no Megami" stage, then the "Ramune no Nomikata" stage

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,640
And finally the 12th anniversary SP

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,980
Until the end

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,360
So that everyone can have a grand celebration for SKE's 12th anniversary

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,560
I humbly request your cooperation

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,760
- Okay, Jurina 
 - Yes!

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,180
Can we please increase the volume of the in-ear mic?

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,540
- Okay, Jurina let's do "Boku wa shitteiru" 
 -Yes, please

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,960
That was good

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Thank you very much

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,440
What kind of "making of" is this?

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,660
They said this might be used for "something"

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
- They'll definitely use this
- Yeah

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,660
Ojuri is a good egg 
(t/n: Suzuran uses a bunch of slang from here on)

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,440
We're chums (lol)

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,500
- It sounds like I'm making you say that 
 - We're great chums

39
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,380
"Chums?" They'll think we're one of those try-hards

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,580
Because we get along well, okemaru?

41
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,480
Jurina-san, are these

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,340
The things you mentioned when you came in earlier? For the staff?

43
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes, these are for the staff

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,740
Some gifts for them

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,900
I always drink these

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,860
Energy drinks

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,380
After this I'm mostly free

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,940
I'm just hammering into my head the things in the rehearsal once again

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,040
And I'll just relax a little, have a meal

50
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,420
And get ready to go all out for the performance

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,160
"Boku wa shitteiru" is

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,540
Sung in the order you joined the group

53
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,280
We're going by the generations

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,720
And somehow, really

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,660
Even the song

56
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,400
Is about things like hoping for our hard work to be rewarded

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,200
Or hoping that we'll be able to smile in the future

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,300
These are the thoughts of fans towards us

59
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,980
The lyrics are about that

60
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,420
So that's why

61
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,820
When I sing that song

62
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,360
I get strength from the song, the lyrics

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Like, I hope the fans would think of us this way

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,760
And even the part where the 1st gens would sing

65
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,980
There used to be many members

66
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
But now it's just me

67
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,340
Part of me does feel sad about it

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,260
But it's a very important song

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,180
- This style might be good 
 - This one?

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,100
Jurina-san, I'm asking out of curiosity but

71
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,400
Earlier weren't you were humming a bunch of songs?

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,460
How many songs do you have in your memory?

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,640
How many songs...

74
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,220
If we count not only SKE but also AKB

75
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,800
There might be around 1000 songs?

76
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,300
1000 songs and their choreography

77
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Was it that many? I'm not sure

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,440
There are some that I haven't performed that much but remember

79
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,120
Maybe I can say 500 songs?

80
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,580
I look like a toy poodle

81
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,120
I like toy poodles

82
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,780
We don't get the impression that you make mistakes often when it comes to lyrics or dance

83
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,860
But what's that like in reality?

84
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,120
For me, probably

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,600
Up till now, I think the number of times I've made mistakes is pretty low

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,660
Even the members around me often tell me things like that

87
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,840
But even if I do make a mistake, I think I cover it up well

88
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,800
I don't act like I've made a mistake

89
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm becoming numb

90
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
- Hmm? 
 - I'm becoming numb

91
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,560
[inaudible]

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
Yes, that's right

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,740
I might feel relieved later too

94
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,900
Like "it's over!"

95
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,360
A Korean fan gave this to me

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Korean makeup

97
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,620
I'm sure that made you happy

98
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,380
Yeah, Korean fans send me lots of things like this

99
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,800
I went with pink today

100
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,580
Usually when you're walking around town

101
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,140
Do you get spotted by your fans?

102
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,760
When I'm walking

103
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,940
When I'm walking in the streets they do call out to me

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,200
Because I'm the type who's fine when people do that

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,740
Usually I end up talking with them

106
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,360
With my fans

107
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,960
Even when I haven't put on any makeup

108
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,800
I'd tell them, sorry for my bare face

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,220
Yeah usually I'd talk to them

110
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,580
Sometimes there would be people who just happen to know me but are not my fans, they'd come speak to me

111
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,580
For those people

112
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,320
I'd try to meet them

113
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,820
And get them to know me as a person

114
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,320
In the hopes they'd end up liking me 

115
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,720
It's not something I dislike at all

116
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,820
Especially when I meet families with young kids

117
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,560
I'd go "hooray!!", because I love kids

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,020
I can't do it right now but

119
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,060
When I see babies I'd go "so cute" and poke their cheeks

120
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,880
I like the cheeks of young kids

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,180
So I'd always try and squish their cheeks

122
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,680
Also, when I find a cute kid

123
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,980
I'd always tell them

124
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,420
Come join SKE when you grow up

125
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,460
I'd be scouting them

126
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,920
I was sent a really nostalgic photo

127
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,700
- Can we see it?
- Isn't that too cute?

128
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,620
That's too cute

129
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,060
It might have been good to go with this hairstyle

130
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
The ones we're doing today

131
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,360
There are many songs I'm quite used to singing and dancing

132
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,320
So I'm probably not as nervous today

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,960
Should I say nervousness?

134
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,200
More like the fear of making a mistake? But probably not fear either

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,320
But I do get nervous

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,580
Since it's like a milestone this time

137
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,880
Because it's my last (SKE anniversary)

138
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,040
So you're saying your performance might go better than usual today?

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,560
Hmm, I wonder about that

140
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,660
Normally, regardless of whether I perform on a big or small stage

141
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,220
I try to keep my feelings the same

142
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,000
That's the aim, but sometimes I do naturally get pumped up

143
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,160
- For "Pareo wa Emerald", Jurina-san please take the first wave
- Yes!

144
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
- Ah, excuse me
- Yes, please go ahead

145
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,140
It's SKE's 12th anniversary

146
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,400
I may be the only member left who's been here from the start 

147
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,920
But since it's a festival celebrating SKE's 12th year

148
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,100
I hope that you all try to feel as though you've been here from the start

149
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,480
When you perform on stage today

150
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,740
How should I say this

151
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,440
There may be members who feel like it's someone else's celebration

152
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,340
Because some of you may have only joined recently

153
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,800
But we're all one team here

154
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
We're all SKE members here, please think of it as your own celebration

155
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
I hope each of you keeps that in mind when you stand on the stage today

156
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,260
And convey our gratitude to the fans

157
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,900
Thank you

158
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
- It's your last mic for the day
- That's right

159
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,300
Mic no. 15, it's 15 (ikou) 

160
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,400
There used to be a lot more 1st gens when we did "Boku wa shitteiru"

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,880
Then it became fewer and fewer

162
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,300
Like recently I ended up coming to the front

163
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
This time too

164
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,940
Senpai corner!

165
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,200
- Senpai corner
- Corner?

166
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
We've all been here around 12 years

167
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
But not much has changed since last year

168
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
(In Nagoya-ben) Not much has changed since last year

169
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,560
- But I thought you two wouldn't be here
- Yeah you're right

170
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,660
We thought you wouldn't be here

171
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,520
- Thanks to you two for staying on...
- It should have been my last day today

172
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,820
- Oh yeah, that's right!
- Yeah, it was to be my final day

173
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,040
- You did say it was going to be the anniversary
- Yes, that was supposed to be the last day

174
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,740
But how do you feel about this?

175
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,380
- It's pretty weird
- I'm sure

176
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,740
There's some good about this but...

177
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,520
But I did "Tetsuna" yesterday

178
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,200
Had things been normal, I couldn't have performed the full Tetsuna

179
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,080
Once we quit we can't do such fun things anymore

180
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,380
- That's kind of sad
- Yeah, that's true

181
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,700
- Sorry for being part of this conversation
- It's all good

182
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,860
You memorised by watching?

183
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,860
That's amazing!

184
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,440
Wow!

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,440
That's perfect

186
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
Eh, it's perfect!

187
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,460
The truth is you want to be in KII right? (lol)

188
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,700
I'll sing while making this face through the whole thing

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,360
Ah, so you actually want to be in Team E? (lol)

190
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,440
You want to be in Team E?

191
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,460
Everyone, we have 1 more important announcement to make

192
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,960
Please watch this video

193
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,900
Yes, there will be a new SKE48 single

194
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,320
About that, Jurina-san

195
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,460
Yes

196
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,500
Did you see it?

197
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,040
I saw it

198
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,100
It's my graduation single

199
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,180
That's right!!

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,960
So that's rearly string?
(t/n: Makki is mispronouncing a word here)

201
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
"Early spring" you mean?

202
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,000
You do that sometimes, don't you? (lol)
(t/n: this is SKE's last single name)

203
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,400
Please tell us your thoughts

204
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Yes, the truth is

205
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
Today was supposed to be my last day

206
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,980
Today, on 5 October

207
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,080
I was supposed to have my graduation stage

208
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,560
It was supposed to be the day I leave my idol days behind

209
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,300
And walk towards a new start

210
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,280
But well, Matsui Jurina is still here to stay

211
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,780
There will still be new starts for me from now on

212
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,200
I'm happy that things were decided like this

213
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,100
And for SKE, it's been a while since we've had a new single too

214
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,260
And since it's my last one too, I'd like it to be an SKE-like song

215
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,080
And also, by the way

216
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,040
It's probably weird to segue into this like this but

217
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,500
But since we're here

218
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,800
I'd like to make another announcement

219
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,060
Well, I mentioned this earlier but

220
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,140
It was supposed to be my last day but things got postponed

221
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,420
And following this

222
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,520
About my activities with SKE

223
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,640
Or for things after my graduation

224
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,280
I'd like to share all kinds of things with the fans

225
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,040
And have more fun together

226
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,800
So I talked with the staff, and the result of the discussion is

227
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,240
That I, Matsui Jurina

228
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,520
Will start a YouTube channel!

229
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,960
Juritube?

230
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,540
Eh, could it be that

231
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,160
The cameras going around filming, are they...?

232
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,160
That might be related (lol)

233
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,660
Ah, there they are! (lol)

234
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,620
If you see them, make sure you say hello

235
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,140
Well, all good times must come to an end

236
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,260
We'd like to perform our final song

237
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,040
How do I put this, for me

238
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
The new single will be released in spring

239
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,060
That means I'll probably be leaving the group around that time

240
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,600
For next year's 13th anniversary

241
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,140
I won't be here, it might be the same for Churi too

242
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,600
You might not be here, I'm not sure though

243
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,460
I've had my 1st anniversary since announcing my graduation

244
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
Well we don't know about that but

245
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,780
The group will soon have no 1st gens left

246
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,280
But I hope everyone continues to liven things up

247
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,040
For the 13th anniversary, I'd like to come watch if I can

248
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,640
I hope everyone livens things up

249
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,580
But also our gratitude towards people who support us

250
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,540
From the members who couldn't be here today due to timing

251
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,300
And those who have already departed from the group

252
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,320
Including all of these

253
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,400
We'd like to perform our next, final song

254
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,320
To convey our gratitude to all of you

255
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,960
Please listen to it

256
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,480
"Boku wa shitteiru"

257
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,620
Yes, the reason I was able to keep going for 12 years was...

258
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,900
But actually in the middle

259
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:14,400
Honestly, there were times I have thought about quitting

260
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,000
How should I put this, I'm easily misunderstood

261
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm the type to react in certain ways in some situations

262
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,160
There were many things that I was the first to do

263
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
I did things that were without precedent

264
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
There were many things like that

265
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,320
And because of that

266
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,420
People formed various opinions about me

267
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,520
When I heard about such things I did get sad

268
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,720
And there were moments I thought of giving up

269
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,860
But I can go on if there's even a single person

270
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,380
Who is cheered up by watching me

271
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,300
And supports me as a fan

272
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Through letters, comments

273
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,020
And coming to handshake events

274
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,020
These things really come through to me

275
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,380
It's because I've had fans like that

276
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,600
That's one of the reasons

277
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,820
And of course, the members are a huge factor

278
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,620
There was no way I could have done this alone

279
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,040
We experienced both pain and joy together

280
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,160
Right now SKE is comprised of my juniors

281
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,520
It was really fun to watch my juniors grow

282
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,380
At first I was like the youngest child

283
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,280
Along the way I started feeling like the older sister or parent

284
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
Also, my family

285
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,700
When my mother was young

286
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,700
She'd wanted to sing and dance

287
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,500
As she wasn't able to do it

288
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,280
She always told me she was happy to see her daughter living her dream

289
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,360
That's why rather than doing this for myself

290
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,260
I felt like doing this for other people

291
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,800
There were many reasons like that

292
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,720
It's because of those reasons that I was able to do my best

293
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,680
Thank you!

294
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,660
[SKE48 and Matsui Jurina are not over yet...]
